# HydrusHelper
Python CLI tool for streamlining Hydrus simulations
The python runner enters the root fraction and climate data into the hydrus program based on a csv files labeled beta and atmosph. An example hydrus workspace (with the correct soil profile/time/parmeter info) is needed for the code to replicate for each sequential simulation. The simulation names are must be entered one per line and saved in the simulation_names.dat file. The time points for each simulation is saved one per line in simulations.dat. The file will run the soil profile with 101 nodes which it populates in the nodes section of the profile.dat file.The inputs for python runner are as follows:
-n (name)
-i file path for input
-s file path for simulations
-o file path for output
--chain-theta

When runner is used the code will generate the first simulation file and ask the user to run the hydrus file from a separate command prompt and hit enter upon a complete run of the hydrus file. Upon hitting enter, the last time pointâ€™s theta value for the previous simulation will be read in as an initial value for the next simulation. This will be repeated for the number of simulations in the simulation files.
Process workspace with pull out h, theta, and ET for all files. The inputs needed are:
-Path to directory containing Hydrus output
-Path to directory where processed data will be stored.
